﻿By using Eqn. (18), we are allowed to express the transition
probability on the undirected graph. We will show the power
of this expression in the following section.
Reviewing Fig. 9, Conditional dependencies between vari-
ables representing different users at the same time slice can be
expressed in the form of pairwise relationship as depicted in
Eqn. (6). The edge across different time slices is formulated
as the pairwise potential function Eqn. (18). The figure shows
an example with time window being 3.
